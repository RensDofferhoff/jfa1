## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Removed the redundant "functions to implement" from the package description
* Changed the package description so that it elaborates on what the package does and why it may be useful.

## Test environments
* OS X install (on travis-ci), R release
* Linux install (on travis-ci), R release

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs or NOTEs. 

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.
